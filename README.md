# Hypothetical E-Commerce Project (Nest.js):
## Microservices:
1. ### Product Service
2. ### User Service

---

* ## NOTE if you're checking commit messages:
    * I used commit message `prefix` as <span style="color:yellow;"> [NM-${COMMIT_NUMBER}] </span> in this pattern `NM` abbrivation stands for Nest.js Microservice & `COMMIT_NUMBER` denotes the current number of commit except `init commit` which is initial commit, I followed this production based practice to keep a track of `Major` & `Minor` releases or projects.

* ## Steps to Get Started

1. #### Clone the repository:
    > git clone https://github.com/ChanderParkash179/nestjs-microservices.git

2. #### Open the project in your preferred coding editor like VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.

3. #### Open a terminal and install dependencies:
    > `npm install`

4. #### Start Docker containers for PostgreSQL and pgAdmin:
    > `docker-compose up` OR `docker-compose up -d`

5. #### Access pgAdmin in your browser do below stes:
    > * Type URL `http://localhost:5050/` hit enter and wait.
    > * Type email:  `admin@email.com` in email section.
    > * Type password: `admin` in password section and hit enter.

    > ![pgAdmin loggin setup](git_images/image.png)

6. #### pgAdmin setup
    > * right click on `Server` and then click on `Register` and then `Server` like shown below:
        ![creating postgres server on pgAdmin](git_images/image-1.png) 

    > * Now Click firstly on `General` tab and type `postgres` in name textbox like shown below:
        ![setting up database connection](git_images/image-2.png)

    > * Now Go to `Connection` tab like shown below:
    > * Enter Host name/address: `postgres`, port: `5432`, Maintaince database: `postgres`, username: `postgres`, password: `postgres` and enable the `Save password` option:
        ![entering required credentials for creating server connection](git_images/image-5.png)
        
7. #### Create two databases: `user` & `product` and wait for 30 seconds.
    > * open server `postgres` server, then open `Databases` after that right click on `Databases` and then on `Create` and then `Database...` for creating new database
        ![redirection to creation of database](git_images/image-6.png) 
    > * now enter name of database in textbox `user` or `product` and then click on `save`, repeat this process for both databases `user` & `product`:
        ![creating database by entering database name](git_images/image-7.png)

8. #### Open a terminal in the `~root` path of the project and start the services by typing.
    > * `npm run start:dev`

9. #### Both microservices will be executed concurrently because I used concurrently package and updated `run` configuration in `package.json` file.

10. #### Now, you can test the provided tasks.
